Download the script.js
Put <script src="script.js"></script> at the bottom of your code above </body></html>.
You can change:
const leftJoystick=false;
to
const leftJoystick=true;
to turn the left DPAD into a joystick with analog input

This likely has bugs but I've done my best for someone who isn't good at whatever the fuck you'd call this.
